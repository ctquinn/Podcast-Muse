This is a personal project to leverage GPT-related tools to condense the information contained within audio long-form files, namely podcasts.

## Getting Started

### 1: Setting Up the Virtual Environment

Before you start, create a virtual environment in the project's root directory (where the `requirements.txt` is located) with the following command:

```


### 3. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install package dependencies:
